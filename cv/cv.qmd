## About Me

Everyday I strive for superior, influential decision-making with data through my work and teams.

I engage with business leaders to identify, prioritize business issues and deliver useful data solutions and insights. I grow successful analytics teams 
that excel at data analysis, visualization and solving business problems. 

My work philosophy is deeply customer and problem-centric: *Imperfect* but *useful* solutions to the *right* problems to advance business objectives.

I would love to continue perfecting my craft as a data analyst and manager by tackling novel, challenging business problems beyond the insurance industry.
