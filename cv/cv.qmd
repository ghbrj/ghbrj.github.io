<br> 
Everyday I strive for superior, influential decision-making with data through my work and teams. I collaborate with business leaders to identify, 
prioritize issues and deliver useful data solutions and insights. 

My work philosophy is deeply customer and problem-centric: *Imperfect* but *useful* solutions to the *right* problems to advance business objectives.

I would love to perfect my craft as an analytics manager and data analyst by tackling novel, challenging business problems within and beyond the insurance industry. 

## Experience 

### Sr. Manager[^1], Claims Analytics
*[Co-operators General Insurance Co.](https://www.cooperators.ca/) | Montreal, QC* [*January 2020 --- Present*]{.dateformat}

Settling claims is the promise made to ~1M policyholders when unfortunate events happen. The claims function pays out roughly $2B per year and has a workforce of ~1600 employees reporting up to 8-10 Assistant Vice-Presidents (AVPs). Tremendous opportunities to improve client, employee outcomes and reduce costs in an environement where the data maturity is low but developing.

The analytics function within Claims needed to grow because of a rapid, significant increase in demand and expectations from business partners for decision-making with data. In this growth phase, it was important to create and maintain a supportive environment to ensure wellbeing of our team of ~30 professionals while delivering valuable and high quality work.
